<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
This repository contains collection of various problem solving approaches to solve algorithmic problems.

I have collected and summarized a general code templates from <a href="https://leetcode.com">Leetcode</a> as it has the best discussion forum. 

First I intended to use it for myself, but then I thought maybe its better to share it with other people as well.
</p>

<h3>Templates</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="./Templates/BinarySearch.md">Binary Search</a></li>
  <li><a href="./Templates/SlidingWindow.md">Sliding Window</a></li>
  <li><a href="./Templates/Trees.md">Trees</a></li>
  <li><a href="./Templates/Graphs.md">Graphs</a></li>
  <li><a href="./Templates/DynamicProgramming.md">Dynamic Programming</a></li>
  <li><a href="./Templates/BinarySearch.md">Backtracking</a></li>
<ul>

<h3>How to use this template?</h3>
<ol>
 <li>If you will have interviews soon, and plan to review data structure & algorithm. You can review by these summary, and improve practical skills by typical examples. </li> 
 <li>If you want to study algorithm by practice, here you can understand the key point in templates, and practice the examples from easy to hard, to understand it deeper.</li>
 <li>If you are a LeetCoder, you want to focus on your weak topics, and have no idea to which problems to solve, here is well classified and provides the most typical examples.     Or,you are too tired to find a fastest and elegant answer in discussion, here can save your time.</li> 
  </ol>

<h3>Special Thanks </h3>
<p>Thanks to all good problems from LeetCode.

 LeetCode is a great OJ platform, and really suitable to do functional and performance test.

Thanks to all the code masters who make leetcode discussion forum truely amazing.</p>

<h3>Referrences</h3>
<p> I scraped the most popular discussions and filter the ones which summarized a general approach to particular domain, such as backtracking, dynamic programming, sliding window, graphs.</p>

Do read the discussions. ðŸ‘‡
